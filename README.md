This repository is archived. All the functionality provided by enki has been ported to [Auroraboot](https://github.com/kairos-io/AuroraBoot) since [version v0.3.0](https://github.com/kairos-io/AuroraBoot/releases/tag/v0.3.0). Also since [v0.3.1](https://github.com/kairos-io/AuroraBoot/releases/tag/v0.3.1), Auroraboot no longer depends on enki (all code has been ported over).

`enki` is the tool used to generate Kairos artifacts (container images, isos etc) and it is used
by [`Auroraboot`](https://kairos.io/docs/reference/auroraboot/) and [osbuilder](https://github.com/kairos-io/osbuilder/)

It's not meant to be used by humans, thus the API and UX are not focusing on user friendliness but
rather on getting things done and fulfilling the requirements of the dependant tools.

NOTE: `enki` was originally part of [osbuilder](https://github.com/kairos-io/osbuilder/) and [was moved to a separate repository](link to PR here).
