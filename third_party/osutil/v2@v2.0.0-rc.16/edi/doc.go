Package edi allows edit files.

The editing of files is very important in the shell scripting to working with
the configuration files. There are a great number of functions related to it,
avoiding to have to use an external command to get the same result and with the
advantage of that it creates automatically a backup before of editing.

NewEdit creates a new struct, edit, which has a variable, CommentChar,
with a value by default, '#'. That value is the character used in comments.
